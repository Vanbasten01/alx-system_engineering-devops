STEP 1:
 	I clicked on the CMD-CHALLENGE's link provided on the project. It took me to a website, where I had to answer many questionis
	regarding the command lines.


STEP 2:
	I took a screenshot of each passed challenge and save them into a folder on my local machine.


STEP 3:
	I hence used SFTP to put the whole folder into the intranet sandbox.


STEP 4:

	to my github.
